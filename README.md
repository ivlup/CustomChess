# Online Chess
This is a chess website where people can play against each other online in real time. 

### Note:
If you're just trying to play a game of chess and you get a Heroku error page, try [FireChess](https://github.com/Aveek-Saha/FireChess). It has far more relaxed resource restrictions and should always be accessible.
